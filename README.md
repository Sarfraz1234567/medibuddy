MediBuddy Insurance Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the MediBuddy insurance dataset. The goal is to analyze various factors affecting insurance charges, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and regional differences.

Dataset Description

The project utilizes two datasets:

Medibuddy_Insurance_Data_Personal.csv – Contains personal details such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region.

Medibuddy_Insurance_Data_Price.csv – Contains insurance charges and policy details.

These datasets are merged using Policy no. as a unique identifier.

Features Analyzed

Age Distribution

BMI and Obesity Analysis

Insurance Charges by Gender, Smoking Status, and Region

Impact of Number of Children on Charges

Correlation Between Age, BMI, and Charges

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis

How to Run the Project

Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Medi.ipynb

Execute the cells in sequence to generate the analysis.

Output and Insights

Smokers tend to have significantly higher insurance charges.

Higher BMI (Obesity) is associated with increased costs.

Certain regions show variations in insurance pricing.

Younger individuals generally have lower insurance charges unless they are smokers.

Future Improvements
